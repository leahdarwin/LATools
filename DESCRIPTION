Description: This package is used to construct and analyze locating arrays. 
  A locating array is a combinatorial tool used to design tests that include interactions. 
  This tool set is able to construct locating arrays from a description of test factors. 
  Once the locating array is constructed along and tested to produce results, an algorithm 
  is used to build models. The model builder will inform the user of important factors and interactions in their system.
